  abstract = {Remotely Sensed Images (RSI) based land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping facilitates applications such as forest logging, biodiversity protection, and urban topographical kinetics. This process has gained more attention with the widespread availability of geospatial and remote sensing data. With recent advances in machine learning and the possibility of processing nearly real-time information on the computer, LULC mapping methods broadly fall into two categories: (i) framework-dependent algorithms, where mappings are done using the in-built algorithms in Geographical Information System (GIS) software and (ii) framework-independent algorithms, which are mainly based on deep learning techniques. Both approaches have their unique advantages and challenges. Along with the working patterns and performances of these two methodologies, this comprehensive review thoroughly analyzes deep learning architectures catering different technical capabilities like feature extraction, boundary extraction, transformer-based mechanism based mechanism, attention mechanism, pyramid pooling and lightweight models. To fine-tune these semantic segmentation processes, current technical and domain challenges and insights into future directions for analysing RSIs of varying spatial and temporal resolutions are summarized. Cross domain users with application specific requirements can make use of this study to select appropriate LULC semantic segmentation models.},

  abstract = {As an important application in remote sensing, landcover classification remains one of the most challenging tasks in very-high-resolution (VHR) image analysis. As the rapidly increasing number of Deep Learning (DL) based landcover methods and training strategies are claimed to be the state-of-the-art, the already fragmented technical landscape of landcover mapping methods has been further complicated. Although there exists a plethora of literature review work attempting to guide researchers in making an informed choice of landcover mapping methods, the articles either focus on the review of applications in a specific area or revolve around general deep learning models, which lack a systematic view of the ever advancing landcover mapping methods. In addition, issues related to training samples and model transferability have become more critical than ever in an era dominated by data-driven approaches, but these issues were addressed to a lesser extent in previous review articles regarding remote sensing classification. Therefore, in this paper, we present a systematic overview of existing methods by starting from learning methods and varying basic analysis units for landcover mapping tasks, to challenges and solutions on three aspects of scalability and transferability with a remote sensing classification focus including (1) sparsity and imbalance of data; (2) domain gaps across different geographical regions; and (3) multi-source and multi-view fusion. We discuss in detail each of these categorical methods and draw concluding remarks in these developments and recommend potential directions for the continued endeavor. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.
